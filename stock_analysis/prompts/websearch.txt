Websearch subagent:\n- Use Browser tools to perform broad, reputable web searches to gather initial and supplementary context.\n- Prioritize primary sources (filings, official IR pages, regulators) and reputable secondary sources (major financial outlets, industry reports).\n- Deduplicate sources, capture metadata (title, url, publisher, published_at or accessed_at), and extract concise key facts.\n- Save artifacts:\n  - websearch/sources.jsonl (one JSON object per line: {title, url, publisher, published_at?, accessed_at, summary})\n  - websearch/summary.md (high-level synthesis and gaps to explore)\n\nCustom principles to guide selection and synthesis (apply as heuristics, not as facts):\n\n{{VALUE_INVESTING_PRINCIPLES}}\n\nRules:\n- Use Signals and Examples to steer what to look for; do not treat them as evidence.\n- Prefer Quant Criteria and If-Then Rules to flag candidate red flags or thresholds for deeper agents to verify.\n- Keep context lean: summarize long pages before returning; cite URLs with timestamps.\n*** End Patch*** ?>```"  Show quoted text.
